# Fake-News-Detector
Fake News Detection System

A Python-based machine learning project for detecting fake news using traditional ML and Hugging Face Transformers. Includes a Flask web app for user-friendly predictions.

## Features

- Train models using both classical ML (PassiveAggressiveClassifier) and Transformer-based (DistilBERT) approaches.
- User-facing web application to classify news headlines and articles.
- Ready-to-use dataset for quick testing.


- End-to-End Pipeline**
  - Includes full scripts for data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
  - Ready-to-use CSV dataset for experimenting or replacing with custom news data.

- Flask Web Application**
  - User-friendly browser interface for submitting news headlines, articles, and receiving real-time classification results (real or fake).

- Educational Focus**
  - Suitable for learning, research, or demonstration of fake news detection techniques in natural language processing and text classification.

- Extensibility**
  - Easily adaptable for new datasets, alternative models, and further improvement in feature engineering or training strategies.

- **Open Source**
  - Repository is provided for further development, experimentation, and collaboration.
